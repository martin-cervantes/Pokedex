# Pokedex

This project is about creating a SPA based on a Pokedex for pokemon. It doesn't build any payments or user authentication. It just a catalog, that is, a browsable list of pokemon that you can filter and access to the details of one of them. It is a single page application built with React and Redux that retrieves data from the API to be stored in the Redux store.
